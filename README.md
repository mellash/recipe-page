## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 with BEM class naming style
- Desktop first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to name classes with BEM styling, which is good for maintainable CSS code. On the HTML side I used [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to make sure I follow the spec for good SEO and accessibility page.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my BEM naming style and responsive page with media queries
